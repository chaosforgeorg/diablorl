This version of DiabloRL has beed built on Kubuntu 10.04 and tested to run on Kubuntu 10.04 and Fedora 13 live cd's.

The game is run by executing the 'rl' binary - just open your terminal emulator, set it's size to 80x25 characters or more (works best with 80x25 though) and run ./rl in this directory. If you get a notice about missing libraries either install them on your system or run "./run_diablo_with_provided_libs.sh" to use the bundled versions.
