 DiabloRL 0.4.5 Version (Tristram to Catacombs)
=============================================================================

  Well folks, the 7 day roguelike has been expanded! Written using GenRogue's 
Valkyrie Input/Output/GUI library. What started as 142KB of FreePascal source
code is quickly growing. Tell us what you think, and perhaps with a bit of luck
a full version of DiabloRL will see the light of day... ;)

  ** IF THE GAME CRASHES ** Please zip up these files from the DiabloRL folder
and send to us for debugging! Thanks!

	log.txt
	error.log (if it exists)

  After death the game leaves "mortem.txt" with the info about the dead 
(or winning) character. You can post it on rec.games.roguelike.misc
newsgroup if you wish, but please add a tag stating [DiabloRL] to the
topic. Posts on forum.chaosforge.org would be greatly appreciated, as well.

  This version is based on Diablo 1.09 single player, as documented by
Jarulf’s Guide to Diablo and Hellfire version 1.62. A few things are
still missing, mostly higher level spells and lower levels of dungeons.

  The full version (should it ever come into being) would have:

 -- the full range of Diablo items, monsters, uniques, prefixes and spells
 -- hell -- with a unique level generator
 -- all the original Diablo quests with the original texts
 -- all the hidden quest locations and uniques
 -- additional quests that by Blizzard that didn''t appear in Diablo
 -- full spell and missile weapon system
 -- three additional Hellfire classes -- Monk, Bard and Barbarian
 -- maybe additional Hellfire content -- spells, items, quests, uniques.
 -- Programmer''s edition -- how the author himself sees the world of Diablo
