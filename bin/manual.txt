 Welcome to Sanctuary! The wonderful world of magic and mayhem where DiabloRL
 takes place. The pages herein are your introduction to the town of Tristram
 and the danger that lurks beneath it.
 
-- Getting Started ------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Upon execution, DiabloRL gives you a choice of classes, the Warrior, Rogue, or
 Sorcerer. Each of these has different starting and maximum stats, as well as
 completely different playstyles.
 
 The Warrior wades through the minions of hell, wielding deadly melee weapons
 with ease. Because of this he often uses a shield, and regardless will adorn
 himself with the most protective armor he can find. He has even been known to
 repair his own armor when the need arises. While he can learn a spell or two,
 he will never be able to master them.
 
 The Rogue slips between groups of enemies with subtle grace, firing volleys
 from her bow to quickly bring down faraway enemies. She tends to wear lighter
 armors than the Warrior, so as to enable better mobility. With her keen sight
 she can deduce when something is trapped, and usually disarm it as well. Her
 fluid movements help her in casting spells, as well.
 
 The Sorcerer wields powerful magic, calling upon them both from his knowledge
 and from the powers woven inside of particular staves. His amazing power comes
 with a price, though for he tends to be too weak to wear the strongest armors.
 His deep study of magic will allow him to recharge staves using the innate
 magic in his surroundings.
 
 Having selected one of these options, you'll need to pick a name. Better pick
 one that you won't regret later in life. Having done so, you will find that
 you are starting at a somewhat odd looking screen:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 At the bottom of the screen you'll find two globes: one blue, one red. These
 are indicative of your mana and life, which are explained a bit later.
 Remember, you'll want these globes to be as full as possible to maintain
 maximum effectiveness at battling hell's minions!
 
 The ! marks to the right of the red globe are your quick slots. Potions and
 scrolls may be placed here, and you can get a better look at what your belt
 contains via the '`' key (It's to the left of the number 1 on your keyboard).
 
 The colored @ symbol in the center of the screen is your character. If you
 find yourself ever uncertain of what any of the other symbols mean, simply
 press the 'l' key to enter look mode. This mode is highly useful, and will
 even divulge how damaged enemies are if you ever have the bad fortune to come
 across one.
 
 If you're bored of staying in one spot, movement is best performed via the
 numerical keypad, though the four directional keys are an option as well.
 
-- Gathering Information ------------------------------------------------------
 
 Once you've gotten the hang of movement via the numpad, you might notice that
 there are a few other @ symbols out there. If you're lonely and feel like
 having a chat, wander up and simply try to move into their square. Should you
 ever be faced with evil looking monsters, this method will instead make a
 melee attack.
 
 These faithful townsfolk will provide you with (somewhat) useful information,
 and might even make the occasional request of you. They could even provide you
 with the services of buying, selling, repairing and recharging, should your
 character be able to persuade them to do so with the proper dialogue options.
 
 Most likely they will direct you to their local church - the areas underneath
 have become a hardship for them of late. But before you delve downwards, take
 a moment to understand your strengths and weaknesses.
 
 The 'c' key will bring up the Character screen, giving all your vital stats.
 Gaining experience will result in gaining levels, which will let you edit your
 Strength, Magic, Dexterity and Vitality. These will effect the rest of your
 character in the following fashion.
 
 Strength determines how hard you can hit with melee weapons, as well as how
 heavy of armor you can wear. Some larger weapons will require higher Strength
 values to wield as well.
 
 Magic will allow you to use better staves, and learn more complex spells. The
 higher your Magic, the more mana there will be at your disposal.
 
 Dexterity rates your overall accuracy and agility. Characters with low amounts
 of Dexterity will find it difficult to hit anything. Complex bows will require
 high Dexterity to wield as well.
 
 Vitality is the overall health of your character. Higher Vitality will result
 in more Life, and perhaps even less sickness for your character.
 
 Life and Mana are the two ratings vital to keep you alive. When Mana reaches
 zero you can no longer cast spells, and when Life reaches zero, you're dead!
 
 The remaining values are:
 
 Armor will modify how much damage you take from physical attacks. The higher
 this number is, the better for your health.
 
 To Hit is the rating of how likely you are to hit an enemy of your own level
 with your current weapon (or lack thereof).
 
 Damage will display a range, which is how hard you can hit the enemy if you
 do manage to connect with a blow or arrow.
 
 ResMagic, ResFire, ResLight are your ability to resist damage in the form of
 general magic, fire, and lightning.
 
 Now that you know a bit more about who you are, let's move on to what you're
 wearing. Best not to go naked into the labyrinth!
 
-- Items and Inventory --------------------------------------------------------
 
 Pressing 'i' will access your inventory, allowing you to see a wealth of
 knowledge about what you're wearing and are carrying. 'TAB' will switch your
 cursor to the items you are wearing and back, and the arrow keys will navigate
 this menu.
 
 Detailed information about the item your cursor is highlighting can be seen at
 the bottom of the screen. Requirements and any magical enchantments will be
 displayed here.
 
 Should you decide to equip any item in your inventory, feel free to press
 'ENTER' to do so. If you find that an item is not to your liking, you can
 unequip it by switching to your equipped inventory (TAB) and pressing 'ENTER'
 once more. If you really don't like an item and want to get rid of it, ’d’
 will drop it on the ground.
 
 Depending on what an item is, it will affect you differently. Armor, Shields
 and Helmets will raise your Armor value, while the various types of weapons
 will all increase your damage. Jewelry of any type is always magically
 enchanted and can have numerous effects. Try to find the best combination for
 your style of playing.
 
 Be aware that different weapons have different styles and effects. Swords can
 easily pierce flesh and armor, while maces break the bones of the undead with
 satisfying crunches. Axes sacrifice defense, as they cannot be wielded at the
 same time as a shield. They're generally slow to hit as well, but they possess
 the highest damage output of any weapon.
 
 Every item than you can equip except jewelry will have a durability value as
 well. If this reaches zero the item will break, never to be recovered.
 
 You might also find in your travels various potions and scrolls. They can be
 put into your belt's empty quickslots from the inventory display via the
 numbers 1-8. Using them simply will require you to press the number of the
 slot you placed the potion in.
 
-- Spells and Skills ----------------------------------------------------------
 
 If you're magically inclined, pressing 'b' will bring up your spell book, with
 a full description of all the spells you know. Any skills your character can
 utilize will be shown here as well.
 
 To cast a spell or use a skill, press 's' to assign what you'd like to use.
 This skill menu will display your known skills and spells, as well as the
 spell and charges on any magical stave you are wielding.
 
 Once you've selected a skill or spell, 'z' will activate it. If your actions
 require a target, a cursor will be displayed, allowing you to rain down
 magical death on your enemies.
 
 Books are special items you can find in the depths of the dungeons below
 Tristram, and will enable you to learn new spells, or perfect the ones you
 already know. Reading them will also allow you to connect briefly with the
 magical powers in the environment, partially restoring your mana.
 
-- In the Depths --------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Rumors have it that underneath the Church in Tristram there may be enemies of
 various sizes and temperaments. Be sure not to disturb them too much. If you do
 happen to find yourself being attacked, walking into their position will
 perform a melee attack. If you're using a bow, 'f' will let you shoot your
 deadly arrows at whatever comes your way.
 
 If you're uncertain of what you're facing, remember to look! This can also be
 very helpful when coming across the various features of the Church like
 chests, barrels, and shrines.
 
 Shrines can be invoked to various effects, and you'll never know what they are
 until you've activated them. Your prayers may benefit you, but regardless of
 how helpful they are, their effects are permanent. Use them wisely.
 
-- Miscellaneous Information --------------------------------------------------
 
 Through the course your travels, you may find yourself in a situation where
 you're asked or required to complete various tasks. Such important events will
 be recorded in your Journal, which you can access via 'j'. You can replay the
 request from this screen.
