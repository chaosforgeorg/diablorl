Welcome to Diablo the Roguelike!

You will be running DiabloRL for the first time. I hope you will find this roguelike game as enjoyable as it was for me to write it.

This game is in active development, and as such please be always sure that you have the most recent version, for bugs are fixed, new features appear, and the game becomes better at every iteration. You can find the lastest version on DiabloRL website, and more info on the following sites:

DiabloRL website       : http://diablo.chaosforge.org/
DiabloRL and CF forums : http://forum.chaosforge.org/
ChaosForge at Facebook : http://facebook.com/ChaosForge
ChaosForge at Twitter  : http://twitter.com/chaosforge_org
ChaosForge at Google+  : http://gplus.to/ChaosForge

But most importatntly, if you find yourself enjoying the game, drop by ChaosForge and donate - it's these donations that keep DiabloRL (and other CF roguelikes) in active development. You can make a difference!
